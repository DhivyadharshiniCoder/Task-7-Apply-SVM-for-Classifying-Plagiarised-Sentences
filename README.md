# 🧠 Task 7 – Support Vector Machines for Plagiarism Detection

In this task, we applied **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to classify sentence pairs as plagiarised or not, using similarity scores from our existing dataset.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- `similarity_output_task3.csv`
- Columns:
  - `Similarity_Score` – cosine similarity between two sentences
  - `Plagiarised` – 1 (yes) or 0 (no)

---

## ⚙️ Models Used
- ✅ SVM with Linear Kernel
- ✅ SVM with RBF (Radial Basis Function) Kernel

We evaluated the models using **Accuracy**, **Classification Report**, and **Confusion Matrix**.

---

## 📈 Output

Each model was evaluated on a 20% test set and visualized using Seaborn heatmaps.
